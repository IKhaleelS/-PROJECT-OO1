<strong><h1>INTRODUCTION TO CODING</h1></strong>

<b><h2>WHAT IS CODING?</h2></b>
<p>Coding or computer programming involves creating step-by-step instructions that have a logical structure. Inputting these instructions means a computer can execute a program, or a compiled set of programs, called software applications.

When you write a computer program using a high-level language like Python,
you are instructing a computer what to do for a specific purpose. This instruction
 is then translated into machine codes and binary bits of information by the computer. Although you can use ready-made 
 and user-friendly applications to do certain tasks, there are many cases when you'll need to customize your programs 
 or software applications, or even develop your own.</p>
 <p>Coding is telling a computer what to do, in a way that, with a bit of translation, it can understand. You give computers instructions in what is known as 'code',
in a similar way to how you might have a recipe for how to cook something.</p>

<p><h3>Computer coding can be classified into four major types:

    <ul><li>Imperative or procedural (examples: Cobol, Fortran, C)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Functional (examples: Haskell, Scala, Clojure)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Logical (examples: Prolog, SQL)</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Object-oriented (examples: Java, C++, Python)</li></ul></h3>
    </p>
<p><h2>HOW DO I START LEARNING TO CODE?</h2></p>
<img src="../Downloads/introduction-to-coding.webp" alt="image">
<p>You can easily learn how to code at any time. Basic coding can even be taught to preschoolers.
    It's best to start at a young age, especially as an elementary school student, when you can make coding your natural second language. Computer coding is very similar to written language, but uses simpler and more structured syntaxes or “grammar”.
    There are a lot of online courses that offer coding,
    and some are even free. If you don't know any high-level computer programming languages,
    it's best to start with learning how to write algorithms. These are not programming languages per sectors,
    but they do define the flow and structure of programs that you want to create. Algorithms serve as a guide once you start programming. Start with easy programming languages, such as Python, if you’re a beginner.
    
    You can practice programming based on existing computer programs.
    You can also practice debugging a program by looking at the wrong codes and wrong syntaxes.
    It's really a trial-and-error process and all about learning from mistakes and coding errors before you become highly proficient in programming.</p>
